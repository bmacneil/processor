A simple 32-bit MIPS processor written in SystemVerilog and tested with Verilator

This is a 32-bit MIPS processor design that uses an expanded version of the very reduced 8-bit instruction set presented in CMOS VLSI Design (http://pages.hmc.edu/harris/cmosvlsi/4e/index.html). 

The main purpose of this project was to test different verification strategies for a moderately complex HDL design with multiple submodules.
